

She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
They'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat, tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone, you can do whatever the hell you want to
Na, na na na na na


Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"No, and I don't care who"
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said "do what you have to do"
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
"Please say no more"
"I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete"
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaving like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
"You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line"
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime


Killing a southern belle
Is all you know how to do
That, and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you too
But I wouldn't have you how you want
I don't want to walk around
I don't even want to breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you want
How come you're not ashamed of what you are?
And sorry that you're the one she got?
Ain't nobody talking now
Nobody nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seeing red
But I wouldn't have you how you want
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle


You keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown out, just like before
The White Lady loves you more
Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet
I know what this metal is for
The White Lady loves you more
I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything to you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow
You wake up in the middle of the night
From a dream you won't remember
Flashing on like a cop's light
You say she's waiting
And I know what for
The White Lady loves you more
The White Lady


He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn


Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity caught stars in her arms
Hello hello kitty happy in in New York City Amity walking like a lucky charm
I'm a neon sign and I stay open all the time
So let's go, go go go

Amity Amity god don't make no junk but it's plain to see he still made me
He told me so
I'm good to go
I'm ready to go

'Cos you laugh and talk, and 'cos you make my world rock
I'm so, so so so
Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity Amity good to go


Dragged down into lowercase
Trying to get your cops to talk right
But they cant put the paper in your face
You're just trying to walk by
So now I got a new game baby
No one's gonna recognize it
Your broken english over their flat, tired remarks
Still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life
Isn't it pretty, yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
I can do everything that your man does except for better
Got no interest now in undressing your kids with cheap angst love letters
You write your name in all of the places no one goes
Some can't be satisfied until everybody knows
Isn't it pretty, yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
Isn't it pretty, yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead (come on)
Isn't it pretty, yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead


We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So come on night
You're a witness, you
You've seen me interrupt
A good old-fashioned fight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So come on
So come on night

Your hand on his arm
Haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin
Calling some friend, trying to cash some check
He's acting dumb
That's what you've come to expect
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
He's wearing your clothes
Head down to toes, a reaction to you
You say you know what he did
But you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye, you're pulling him through
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out 6th and powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk walk walk
Four more blocks, plus the one in my brain
Down downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself
And I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure
So I can be quiet whenever I want
So leave me alone
You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay


A low-riding junkie girl
Rode down south to your little world
Like a dream
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
She kicked New York like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to Queens
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see 'round here
I'm waiting for something that not coming


You keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown out, just like before
The White Lady loves you more

For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy
It really made her sad
Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay, let's just forget all about it
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine
Like this one here
Her alone, nobody near
What a shame, let's just not talk about it
No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots, that's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside
With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
Cos I don't know who's around
And you look scared
It's our secret, do not tell, okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell, okay?
Let's just forget all about it


Two-dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped-on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And it's okay, I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
But when it's 3am we wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over down
And he'll drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town


Alphabet City is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong
You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said show me around this alphabet town
Said show me around
There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it
And just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I know what you are
I just don't like it
I won't say you're wrong
I know it's what you want
And it's what I want
So let's go out
I'm ready to go out
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town


At a party 
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Ever thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here


Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease

Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op TV
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong

You go walking by
Here come another guy
Jailer who sells
Personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
I'm so sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

Someone's always coming around here, trailing some new kill
Says I've seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill
And what's a game of chance to you, to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you
Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows, there's money to be made
Go on and lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade
And you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil
Angeles
Don't start me trying now
'Cos I'm all over it
Angeles
I could make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you
Angeles

Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cos everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it
No not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last

Well I hope you're not waiting
Waiting 'round for me
'Cos I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last


She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
They'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat, tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone, you can do whatever the hell you want to
Na, na na na na na


They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
While he's turning around the "Open" sign
"Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
You did anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind
"Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"


We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So come on night

Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So come on
So come on night


Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-11
In St. Ides Heaven
I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smile and you think it's a frown turned upside-down
Cos everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
And I won't come down for anyone

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out 6th and powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk walk walk
Four more blocks, plus the one in my brain
Down downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself
And I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure
So I can be quiet whenever I want
So leave me alone
You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay


He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn


No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross
It's sick what I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand
Well I know how much you care
Don't be cross
It's sick what I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear


Here if you want me
Listening so close 
From far away
I memorized what you’ve told me

Like a foreigner on holiday 
I know to smile at confusion
And don’t forget the soul that smiles on me
Dancing on the Highway

The broken line that led 
From you to me
Well I’ll be at my station all night
So come on by if you feel like

Still here if you want me 
Look at what I can do with empty time
A lost love that likes to haunt me
It’s waiting around to meet me when I die

Death surrounds, 
Protects the living
This is what you said and I agreed 
Not to be so unforgiving

Just because your soul’s 
On time and free
Because I’m here if you want me, my love, 
Dancing on the Highway

But your sun still burns me eye
Oh why, oh why?


Alphabet City is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong
You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said show me around this alphabet town
Said show me around
There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it
And just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I know what you are
I just don't like it
I won't say you're wrong
I know it's what you want
And it's what I want
So let's go out
I'm ready to go out
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town


Bottle up and explode over and over
Keep the troublemaker below
Put it away and check out for the day
In for a round of overexposure
The thing mother nature provides
To get up and go
Bottle up and explode, seeing stars surrounding you
Red white and blue

You look at him like you've never known him
But I know for a fact that you have
The last time you cried
Who'd you think was inside?
Thinking that you were about to come over
But I'm tired now of waiting for you
You never show
Bottle up and go, if you're gonna hide, it's up to you
I'm coming through

Bottle up and go
I can make it outside
I'll get through 
Becoming you
Becoming you
Becoming you


Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"No, and I don't care who"
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said "do what you have to do"
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
"Please say no more"
"I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete"
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaving like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
"You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line"
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime

They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
While he's turning around the "Open" sign
"Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
You did anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind
"Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"


For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy
It really made her sad
Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay, let's just forget all about it
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine
Like this one here
Her alone, nobody near
What a shame, let's just not talk about it
No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots, that's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside
With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
Cos I don't know who's around
And you look scared
It's our secret, do not tell, okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell, okay?
Let's just forget all about it


She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
They'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat, tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone, you can do whatever the hell you want to
Na, na na na na na

Last call
He was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off and goodbye
Well you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis
You're an icicle
You're a tongueless talker
You don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just, just walk away
And that's all you do
The clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew
Last call
He was sick of it all
The endless stream of reminders
Made him so sick of you sick of you sick of you
Sick of your sound
Sick of you coming around
Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done
You can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah yeah you're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure
You can't ask for more ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon
You start to drink and just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
You start to drink and just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
Church bells and now I'm awake
And I guess it must be some kind of holiday
I can't seem to join in the celebration
But I'll go to the service
And I'll go to pray
And I'll sing the praises of my maker's name
Like I was as good as she made me
And I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me


Killing a southern belle
Is all you know how to do
That, and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you too
But I wouldn't have you how you want
I don't want to walk around
I don't even want to breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you want
How come you're not ashamed of what you are?
And sorry that you're the one she got?
Ain't nobody talking now
Nobody nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seeing red
But I wouldn't have you how you want
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle


He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell

Knew we'd put up with anything
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn


A low-riding junkie girl
Rode down south to your little world
Like a dream
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
She kicked New York like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to Queens
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see 'round here
I'm waiting for something that not coming


Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-11
In St. Ides Heaven
I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smile and you think it's a frown turned upside-down
Cos everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
And I won't come down for anyone


Every time the day darkens down and goes away
Pictures open in my head of me and you
Silent and cliche, all the things we did and didn't say
Covered up by what we did and didn't do
Going through every out i used to cop to make the repetition stop
What was I supposed to say?

Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone
I'm going home
I wish I'd never seen your face


They asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
Traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
'Cos he's fucking up even the simplest lines
They say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When the clean the streets I'll be the only shit that's left behind

Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
Won't you follow me down to the rose parade?


At a party 
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Ever thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here

Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"No, and I don't care who"
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said "do what you have to do"
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
"Please say no more"
"I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete"
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
You better start watching what message that you send now

And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime

Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime


Someone's always coming around here, trailing some new kill
Says I've seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill
And what's a game of chance to you, to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you
Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows, there's money to be made
Go on and lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade
And you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil
Angeles
Don't start me trying now
'Cos I'm all over it
Angeles
I could make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you
Angeles


They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
While he's turning around the "Open" sign
"Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
You did anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind
"Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"


No confidence man
Charlie got a band in his hand
A rubber loop
Says I'm the man you really want
So just act natural
Don't try to tell me your bullshit scheme
'cos I have no idea what you mean
No idea
I'm just trying to sleep
I've heard quite enough
Just to listen is really tough
'cos you're on it all the time
Hearing the bells it's 9am
You better wake up your friend before he won't wake up anymore
'cos I got to split I'm late to leave
He gave me nothing but grief
And some bullshit story only I would believe
I've heard quite enough
I heard quite enough
You're on it all the time
You're on it all the time
You're on it all the time
And you're full of it all the time

First the mic, then a half cigarette
Singing Kathy's clown
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed
So she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

Now she's done, and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
'Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Can't you tell that it's well understood?

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow

I'm here today, expect it to stay on, and on, and on
I'm tired, I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO Mom
It's OK, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans
To just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now but I'm gonna love you anyhow


He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials all over the place


Two-dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped-on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And it's okay, I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
But when it's 3am we wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over down
And he'll drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town


I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after
We broke up a month ago, and I grew up - I didn't know
I'd be around the morning after

It's always been wait and see
A happy day and then you'll pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around
And instead of falling down
I'm standing up the morning after
Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after

Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says it 'til it shows
See how it is, they want you or they don't
Say yes

I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after


At a party 
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms

I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Ever thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here


Alphabet City is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong
You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said show me around this alphabet town
Said show me around
There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it
And just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I know what you are
I just don't like it
I won't say you're wrong
I know it's what you want
And it's what I want
So let's go out
I'm ready to go out
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town


Last call
He was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off and goodbye
Well you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis
You're an icicle
You're a tongueless talker
You don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just, just walk away
And that's all you do
The clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew
Last call
He was sick of it all
The endless stream of reminders
Made him so sick of you sick of you sick of you
Sick of your sound
Sick of you coming around
Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done
You can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah yeah you're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure
You can't ask for more ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon
You start to drink and just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
You start to drink and just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
Church bells and now I'm awake
And I guess it must be some kind of holiday
I can't seem to join in the celebration
But I'll go to the service
And I'll go to pray
And I'll sing the praises of my maker's name
Like I was as good as she made me
And I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me


We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So come on night
You're a witness, you
You've seen me interrupt
A good old-fashioned fight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So come on
So come on night


Throwing candy out to the crowd, dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley, having had enough of it all

Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you

All spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger

You can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to, there's no one to stop you
Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to though it doesn't mean a thing
Big nothing


There was a grown man dying from fright
So surprised at the things he'd say
With a giant fantasy life
Runnin 'round on feet of clay

Naked except for a perpetual debt
That couldn't be stripped away
An unrightable wrong that moved him along 
Closer to division day

Spent a long time living with that
Never could give it a name
And when you don't know what you're looking at 
It makes it much harder to take

Mostly they'd meet when he was asleep 
And have some sick exchange
That stuck him as wrong and moved him along 
Closer to division day

I can't make an exception for a bad Connection 
That only goes one way
Sell out for a song where I don't belong
With you on division day

The moon stood up on the ridge
Looking down where the water shines
And a man looking over the bridge
Like he done so many times

Thinking about how to stay out
Out of troubles way 
And Flying to fall away from you all
It's over division day
Beautiful division day

Thinking about how to stay out
Out of troubles way
Flying to fall away from you all
It's over division day
Beautiful division day


Pretty Mary K walks along the docks
With some sailor's pay shoved down in her sock
Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue
Who can't stay away from you

Pretty Mary K, take him back to town
I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds
Up against the wall, crying black and blue
Keeps me away from you

Pretty words that you whisper, maybe I misunderstood
Somebody's not paying attention
What they promised and their word isn't good

Oh, Mary K, I can see her face
Down there in the waves, painted and erased
But I know it's just the reflection of the moon
A big fake resembling you

Gonna go down in the water, fill my mouth up full of sand
I'll be waiting, still impatient
With my dead imagination while you're with some other man

Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room
I'm down here by the bay with my arm around the moon
But I'll be with you soon, just as soon as I pay
I walk across the water with pretty Mary k
Walk on water, pretty Mary K

For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy
It really made her sad
Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay, let's just forget all about it
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine
Like this one here
Her alone, nobody near
What a shame, let's just not talk about it
No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots, that's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside
With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
Cos I don't know who's around
And you look scared
It's our secret, do not tell, okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell, okay?
Let's just forget all about it


She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
They'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat, tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone, you can do whatever the hell you want to
Na, na na na na na


Killing a southern belle
Is all you know how to do
That, and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you too
But I wouldn't have you how you want
I don't want to walk around
I don't even want to breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you want
How come you're not ashamed of what you are?
And sorry that you're the one she got?
Ain't nobody talking now
Nobody nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seeing red
But I wouldn't have you how you want
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle


Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-11
In St. Ides Heaven
I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smile and you think it's a frown turned upside-down
Cos everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
And I won't come down for anyone


Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"No, and I don't care who"
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said "do what you have to do"
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
"Please say no more"
"I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete"
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaving like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
"You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line"
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime


No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross
It's sick what I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand
Well I know how much you care
Don't be cross
It's sick what I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

A low-riding junkie girl
Rode down south to your little world
Like a dream
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
She kicked New York like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to Queens
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see 'round here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see 'round here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see 'round here
I'm waiting for something that not coming


He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance

It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
Running speed trials all over the place


No confidence man
Charlie got a band in his hand
A rubber loop
Says I'm the man you really want
So just act natural
Don't try to tell me your bullshit scheme
'cos I have no idea what you mean
No idea
I'm just trying to sleep
I've heard quite enough
Just to listen is really tough
'cos you're on it all the time
Hearing the bells it's 9am
You better wake up your friend before he won't wake up anymore
'cos I got to split I'm late to leave
He gave me nothing but grief
And some bullshit story only I would believe
I've heard quite enough
I heard quite enough
You're on it all the time
You're on it all the time
You're on it all the time
And you're full of it all the time

You keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown out, just like before
The White Lady loves you more
Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet
I know what this metal is for
The White Lady loves you more
I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything to you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow
You wake up in the middle of the night
From a dream you won't remember
Flashing on like a cop's light
You say she's waiting
And I know what for
The White Lady loves you more
The White Lady


Two-dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped-on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And it's okay, I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
But when it's 3am we wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over down
And he'll drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town

He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn

At a party 
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Ever thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here


No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross
It's sick what I want

Fake concerns is what's the matter, man

Well I know how much you care
Don't be cross

Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear


Here in line where stupid shit collides with dying shooting stars
All we got to show what we really are is the same kind of scars
And looking at you, all I see is you're waiting for something
Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
If you're choking up, take this paper cup, but there's a price you'll pay
For trying hard to become whatever they are, and saying whatever they say
So help yourself to this bitter pill
Or somebody else will
Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
Single file
Single file
Single file
Single file


I'm waiting for the train
Subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that'll come to pull us apart
And make everybody late
You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
Now I'm a crashed credit card registered to Smith -
Not the name that you called me with
You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flaked paint
Oh we're so very precious, you and I
And everything that you do makes me want to die
Oh I just told the biggest lie
I just told the biggest lie
The biggest lie
